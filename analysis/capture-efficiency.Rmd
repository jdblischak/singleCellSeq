**Last updated:** `r Sys.Date()`

**Code version:** `r system("git log -1 --format='%H'", intern = TRUE)`

```{r chunk-options, include=FALSE}
source("chunk-options.R")
library("edgeR")
library("ggplot2")
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14))
```

Here capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of the added ERCC spike-in molecules that were sequenced.

## Input

Input annotation.

```{r input-annotation}
anno <- read.table("../data/annotation.txt", header = TRUE,
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(anno)
```

Input ERCC concentration information.

```{r input-ercc}
ercc <- read.table("../data/ercc-info.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t",
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(ercc) <- c("num", "id", "subgroup", "conc_mix1", "conc_mix2",
                    "expected_fc", "log2_mix1_mix2")
head(ercc)
stopifnot(nrow(ercc) == 92)
```

Input molecule counts.

```{r input-molecule-counts}
molecules <- read.table("../data/molecules.txt", header = TRUE,
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Input list of quality single cells.

```{r input-quality-single-cells}
quality_single_cells <- scan("../data/quality-single-cells.txt",
                             what = "character")
```

Input quality control data.

```{r qc-data}
qc <- read.table("../data/qc-ipsc.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
stopifnot(nrow(qc) == sum(anno$well != "bulk"))
```

## Prepare single cell molecule data

Remove bulk samples.

```{r remove-bulk}
molecules_single <- molecules[, anno$well != "bulk"]
anno_single <- anno[anno$well != "bulk", ]
```

Remove genes with zero read counts in the single cells.

```{r remove-non-expressed-genes}
expressed_single <- rowSums(molecules_single) > 0
molecules_single <- molecules_single[expressed_single, ]
dim(molecules_single)
```

How many genes have greater than or equal to 1,024 molecules in at least one of the cells?

```{r over-expressed}
overexpressed_genes <- rownames(molecules_single)[apply(molecules_single, 1,
                                                        function(x) any(x >= 1024))]
```

`r length(overexpressed_genes)` have greater than or equal to 1,024 molecules.

## Calculate number of ERCC molecules added to each well

Invitrogen provides the concentration of each ERCC spike-in in attomoles per uL.

```{r ercc-conc-mix1}
summary(ercc$conc_mix1)
```

PoYuan diluted mix 1 1:2500.
Then she combined 1 uL of this 1:2500 diluted mix with 19 uL of other stuff to create 20 uL of lysis buffer.
She added 9 uL of lysis buffer to the C1 chip.
Each well received 13.5 uL of lysis buffer.

How many molecules do we expect each sample to contain?

```{r calculate-expected-molecules}
# Dilute 1:2500
ercc_conc_diluted <- ercc$conc_mix1 / 2500
# Dilute 1:20
ercc_conc_lysis <- ercc_conc_diluted / 20
ercc_molecules_lysis <- ercc_conc_lysis *
                        20 * # Number of uL of lysis buffer
                        1/10^18 * # Number of attomoles in a mole
                        6.02214179e23 # Number of molecules in a mole
# 9 uL added to chip
ercc_molecules_chip <- ercc_molecules_lysis * 9 / 20
summary(ercc_molecules_chip)
# 13.5 uL per well
ercc_molecules_well <- ercc_molecules_lysis * 13.5e-3 / 20
summary(ercc_molecules_well)
sum(ercc_molecules_well)
sum(ercc_molecules_well >= 1)
sum(ercc_molecules_well > 1024)
sum(ercc_molecules_well %% 2 == 0)
```

[Pollen et al.][Pollen2014] calculated that they had 28,000 molecules per sample.
Thus our estimate of `r sprintf("%.1f", sum(ercc_molecules_well))` seems reasonable, especially since we diluted our samples more.

[Pollen2014]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4191988/

```{r ercc-index}
ercc_index <- grep("ERCC", rownames(molecules_single))
length(ercc_index)
```

`r length(ercc_index)` of the ERCC spike-ins had at least one molecule observed in at least one of the `r ncol(molecules_single)` single cells.

## Capture efficiency

The "capture efficiency" is defined differently across studies.
Some use it to report the number of wells that had exactly one viable cell out of the possible 96 on a C1 chip.
Others use it to report how many of the added ERCC spike-in molecules were successfully sequenced.
We are using the latter definition.
Thus after calculating the total number of expected ERCC molecules, I simply add up all the ERCC molecules observed for a given single cell and divide it by this total.

```{r capture-efficiency}
efficiency <- numeric(length = ncol(molecules_single))
total_ercc_molecules <- sum(ercc_molecules_well)
for (i in 1:ncol(molecules_single)) {
  efficiency[i] <- sum(molecules_single[ercc_index, i]) / total_ercc_molecules
}
summary(efficiency)
```

## Factors affecting capture efficiency

```{r combine-qc-efficiency}
qc$efficiency <- efficiency
qc$quality <- anno_single$sample_id %in% quality_single_cells
```

Single cells from batch 2 of individual 19098 ahve the highest efficiency.
This was expected since they have an [abnormally high ERCC ratio](qc-cell-ipsc.html#total-mapped-reads-unmapped-ratios-and-ercc-ratios).

```{r efficiency-19098-2-outlier}
efficiency_box <- ggplot(qc, aes(y = efficiency, x = as.factor(individual), fill = as.factor(batch))) +
  geom_boxplot()
efficiency_box
```

Removing batch 2 of individual 19098.

```{r qc-remove-19098-batch-2-single}
qc_sub <- qc[!(anno_single$individual == 19098 & anno_single$batch == 2), ]
```

```{r efficiency-wo-19098-2-outlier}
efficiency_box %+% qc_sub
```

There doesn't seem to be a relationship between Bioanalyzer concentration and capture efficiency.

```{r efficiency-concentration}
efficiency_conc <- ggplot(qc_sub, aes(x = concentration, y = efficiency)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(batch ~ individual) +
  geom_smooth()
efficiency_conc
```

And this does change when limiting to high quality cells.

```{r efficiency-concentration-quality}
efficiency_conc %+% qc_sub[qc_sub$quality, ]
```

The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cell number.
This is expected because the more RNA that is present in a well, the ERCC spike-ins are a lower percentage of the total.
However, this effect is not striking.

```{r efficiency-cell-number}
efficiency_cells <- ggplot(qc_sub, aes(x = cell_number, y = efficiency)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
efficiency_cells
```

## Visualizing capture efficiency

Creating a visualization similar to [Figure 2I][Islam2014Fig2] in [Islam et al.][Islam2014].

[Islam2014]: http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n2/full/nmeth.2772.html
[Islam2014Fig2]: http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n2/fig_tab/nmeth.2772_F2.html

First filter to only keep quality single cells.

```{r qc-filter}
molecules_single <- molecules_single[, colnames(molecules_single) %in% quality_single_cells]
anno_single <- anno_single[anno_single$sample_id %in% quality_single_cells, ]
stopifnot(ncol(molecules_single) == nrow(anno_single),
          colnames(molecules_single) == anno_single$sample_id)
```

Also remove batch 2 of individual 19098.

```{r remove-19098-batch-2-single, eval=FALSE}
molecules_single <- molecules_single[, !(anno_single$individual == 19098 & anno_single$batch == 2)]
anno_single <- anno_single[!(anno_single$individual == 19098 & anno_single$batch == 2), ]
stopifnot(ncol(molecules_single) == nrow(anno_single))
```

```{r create-ercc-plot-data}
ercc_list <- list()
for (spike in ercc$id) {
  if (spike %in% rownames(molecules_single)) {
    ercc_list$id <- c(ercc_list$id, spike)
    ercc_list$observed_mean <- c(ercc_list$observed_mean,
                                 mean(as.numeric(molecules_single[spike, ])))
    ercc_list$observed_sem <- c(ercc_list$observed_sem,
                                 sd(as.numeric(molecules_single[spike, ])) /
                                 sqrt(ncol(molecules_single)))
    ercc_list$expected <- c(ercc_list$expected,
                            ercc_molecules_well[ercc$id == spike])
  }
}
ercc_plot <- as.data.frame(ercc_list, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(ercc_plot)
```

```{r ercc-capture-efficiency, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
p_efficiency <- ggplot(ercc_plot, aes(x = expected, y = observed_mean)) +
  geom_point(col = "red") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = observed_mean - observed_sem,
                    ymax = observed_mean + observed_sem), width = 0) +
  labs(x = "Expected ERCC molecules",
       y = "Observed ERCC molecules\n(mean +/- sem)",
       title = "ERCC capture efficiency")
p_efficiency
```

There plot appears to be log-transformed (it doesn't explicitly say this in the axes or legend).

```{r ercc-capture-efficiency-log10, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
p_efficiency + scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(x = "log10 Expected ERCC molecules",
       y = "log10 Observed ERCC molecules\n(mean +/- sem)",
       title = "ERCC capture efficiency - log transformed")
```

Here is their result:
